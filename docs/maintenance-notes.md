## Maintenance Notes

List of things to be aware of for future maintenance issues. If the system image breaks or there's
a build error, check here first!

### `appimagelauncher`: Using GitHub Release builds / Disabled

- No usable COPR is available for AppImageLauncher, probably cause the last stable version is from
  2020.
- **DISABLED**: might be causing issues with Plasma 6.5 (needs further investigating)
- **Will need to manually bump release URL for updates.**

### `kwin-effect-roundcorners`: Disabled

- Might be causing issues with Plasma 6.5 (needs further investigating)
